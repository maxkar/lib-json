# Simple JSON serialization and deserialization library.

## Use cases

Target use-cases for this library:
 * Parse json into some data object or set of primitives (method arguments, etc...)
 * To generate a new json representation from some objects or simple values

This library aimed to be extensible. For example, if you parse dates is some
specific format, you should be able to provide automatic conversions from and
to the serialized string.
